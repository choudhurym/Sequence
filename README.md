# Sequences
This is one of my class project. The goal of this project was to make 5 computational programs to print out the first 50 terms of Lazy Caterer's Sequence, Prime Numbers, Fibonacci Sequence, Collatz Time Stopping and Happy Numbers. The makefile helps to complie and run the code in terminal by simply typing make.
